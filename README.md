This project is generated with [yo angular generator](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-angular)
version 0.16.0.

## Requirements

* node
* npm
* grunt
* bower

## Installation (First set up)

Check if node and npm are installed.  
**Important:** Maybe it is needed to add node to the PATH on Windows.

**It is recommended to use a UNIX like terminal for the following commands.**  

Run 'npm install bower -g' to install bower.  
Run 'npm install grunt-cli -g' to install grunt command line interface.  
Check if bower and grunt are installed with 'bower --version' and 'grunt --version'. Maybe it is needed to restart the terminal.  

cd /path/to/the/repo/  
Run 'npm install' to install all node modules (grunt etc.).  
Run 'bower install' to install necessary bower modules (angular etc.)  
Run 'grunt serve' to start your browser on 'localhost:9000'.  

The app runs on a local server with live reloading when code is edited (except for HTML files)

## Notes

Each time new modules are installed you have to run 'npm install' and 'bower isntall'.

## Build & development

Run `grunt` for building and `grunt serve` for preview.
Run 'grunt build' to build and process some further optimation of the app. 

## Testing

Running `grunt test` will run the unit tests with karma.
